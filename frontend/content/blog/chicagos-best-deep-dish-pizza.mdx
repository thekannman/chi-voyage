Deep dish pizza is more than just a meal in Chicagoâ€”it&apos;s a cultural institution.
From the original Pizzeria Uno to modern interpretations, this guide will help you
navigate the city&apos;s deep dish scene like a local.

## The History of Deep Dish

Deep dish pizza was invented in 1943 at Pizzeria Uno in Chicago. The thick,
buttery crust and layers of cheese, toppings, and sauce revolutionized pizza
in America. Today, several iconic pizzerias continue this tradition while
others put their own spin on the classic.
