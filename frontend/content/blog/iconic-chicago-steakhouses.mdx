Chicago and steakhouses go hand-in-hand. The city, historically tied to the meatpacking industry, boasts some of the country's most revered temples of beef. From dimly lit, wood-paneled rooms serving classic cuts with unwavering tradition to sleek, modern interpretations offering inventive sides and global influences, Chicago's steakhouse scene caters to every preference.
