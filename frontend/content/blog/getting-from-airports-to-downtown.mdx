So you've landed in Chicago! Now, how do you get from the airport to your hotel or destination downtown? Chicago is served by two major airports: O'Hare International Airport (ORD) to the northwest and Midway International Airport (MDW) to the southwest. Luckily, both offer several transportation options to fit different budgets and preferences.

This guide breaks down the most common ways to travel between ORD/MDW and downtown Chicago (the Loop, River North, Streeterville, etc.).

## From O'Hare International Airport (ORD)

O'Hare is one of the busiest airports in the world and is located about 17 miles northwest of the Loop.

### 1. CTA Blue Line 'L' Train

*   **How it Works:** The most budget-friendly option. The Blue Line station is located on the lower level of Terminal 2 (follow signs for "CTA Trains" or "Trains to City"). Accessible via pedestrian tunnels from Terminals 1 and 3. (From Terminal 5 - International, take the free Airport Transit System (ATS) people mover to Terminal 2).
*   **Cost:** Standard CTA fare (currently $5 from O'Hare, subject to change - check CTA website). Payable via Ventra card/app or contactless bank card.
*   **Time:** Approximately 45-50 minutes to the Loop.
*   **Pros:** Cheapest option by far, avoids traffic, runs 24/7, direct access to Loop/West Loop/Wicker Park areas.
*   **Cons:** Can get crowded (especially during rush hour), limited luggage space, might require a transfer or walk/taxi from the Loop station to your final destination.

### 2. Taxis

*   **How it Works:** Follow signs for "Taxi Stands" outside baggage claim at each terminal.
*   **Cost:** Metered fare, typically $40-$50+ to downtown, depending on traffic and exact destination. Airport departure tax applies.
*   **Time:** 30-60+ minutes, highly dependent on traffic.
*   **Pros:** Convenient door-to-door service, readily available.
*   **Cons:** Expensive (especially with traffic), susceptible to traffic delays.

### 3. Rideshare (Uber/Lyft)

*   **How it Works:** Request via app. Pickups occur at designated Rideshare Pickup zones. For Domestic Terminals (1, 2, 3), pickups are typically on the **Upper Level (Departures)** between Terminal 1 and 2, and between Terminal 2 and 3. For Terminal 5 (International), pickups are on the **Lower Level (Arrivals)** outside Door 5B. **Follow signs and app instructions carefully.**
*   **Cost:** Varies greatly based on demand (surge pricing), traffic, and service level. Often $40-$60+, sometimes more or less than taxis.
*   **Time:** 30-60+ minutes, dependent on traffic.
*   **Pros:** Convenient app-based booking, potential for different service levels (shared, standard, XL).
*   **Cons:** Can be expensive (especially surge pricing), subject to traffic, designated pickup zones require walking.

### 4. Airport Shuttles (e.g., Go Airport Express)

*   **How it Works:** Shared van service that takes multiple passengers to various downtown/suburban locations. Pre-booking is recommended.
*   **Cost:** Per person rate, generally falls between CTA and taxi/rideshare costs.
*   **Time:** Can take longer due to multiple stops (60-90+ minutes).
*   **Pros:** Cheaper than taxi/rideshare for solo travelers, door-to-door service (usually).
*   **Cons:** Slower due to shared rides, requires coordination/booking.

## From Midway International Airport (MDW)

Midway is closer to downtown (about 10 miles southwest) and generally quicker to get to/from.

### 1. CTA Orange Line 'L' Train

*   **How it Works:** The most budget-friendly option. The station is located inside the airport complex, connected via an enclosed walkway east of the terminal building (follow signs for "CTA Trains" or "Trains to City").
*   **Cost:** Standard CTA fare (currently payable via Ventra or contactless). *No airport surcharge like O'Hare.*
*   **Time:** Approximately 25-30 minutes to the Loop.
*   **Pros:** Cheap, efficient, avoids traffic, direct access to the Loop.
*   **Cons:** Can get crowded, limited luggage space, doesn't run 24/7 (operates roughly 4 AM - 1 AM, check schedule), might require transfer/walk from Loop station.

### 2. Taxis

*   **How it Works:** Follow signs for "Taxi Stands" outside baggage claim.
*   **Cost:** Metered fare, typically $30-$40+ to downtown, depending on traffic.
*   **Time:** 20-40+ minutes, dependent on traffic.
*   **Pros:** Convenient door-to-door service.
*   **Cons:** More expensive than CTA, susceptible to traffic.

### 3. Rideshare (Uber/Lyft)

*   **How it Works:** Request via app. Pickups occur at a designated area on the **Lower Level (Arrivals)** outside Door 4. Follow signs and app instructions.
*   **Cost:** Varies with demand and traffic, often $30-$50+, sometimes more or less than taxis.
*   **Time:** 20-40+ minutes, dependent on traffic.
*   **Pros:** Convenient app-based booking.
*   **Cons:** Can be expensive (surge pricing), subject to traffic.

### 4. Airport Shuttles (e.g., Go Airport Express)

*   **How it Works:** Similar shared van service as from O'Hare. Pre-booking recommended.
*   **Cost:** Per person rate, between CTA and taxi/rideshare.
*   **Time:** Can take longer due to multiple stops (45-60+ minutes).
*   **Pros:** Cheaper than taxi/rideshare for solo travelers, door-to-door.
*   **Cons:** Slower due to shared rides.

## Which Option is Best?

*   **Most Budget-Friendly:** CTA 'L' Trains (Blue Line from ORD, Orange Line from MDW).
*   **Fastest (Often, Avoiding Traffic):** CTA 'L' Trains.
*   **Most Convenient (Door-to-Door):** Taxis or Rideshares.
*   **Best Balance (Solo Traveler):** Possibly Airport Shuttles (if prioritizing door-to-door over speed).
*   **Traveling with Lots of Luggage:** Taxis, Rideshares, or Shuttles might be easier than navigating crowded trains.

## Conclusion

Chicago offers reliable options for getting from both O'Hare and Midway airports to downtown. The CTA trains provide unbeatable value and often the most predictable travel times, especially during rush hour. Taxis, rideshares, and shuttles offer more door-to-door convenience at a higher price point. Choose the option that best suits your budget, time constraints, luggage situation, and comfort level.
