Chicagoans love their brunch. It's not just a meal; it's a weekend ritual, a chance to catch up with friends, recover from the night before, or simply indulge in delicious food and perhaps a morning cocktail. The city's breakfast and brunch scene is as diverse as its neighborhoods, offering everything from no-frills greasy spoons to chic cafes and internationally inspired menus.

Whether you're craving fluffy pancakes, savory Benedicts, or something more adventurous, here's a guide to some top spots to start your day right in Chicago.

## Trendy & Scene-y Brunch Spots

These spots often combine great food with a lively atmosphere – expect potential waits, especially on weekends.

*   **Little Goat Diner (West Loop):** Stephanie Izard's playful take on a diner offers creative, globally inspired comfort food. Think "This Little Piggy Went to China" (a savory breakfast scallion pancake creation) or "Bull's Eye French Toast."

## Classic Diners & Old-School Vibes

Sometimes you just need a straightforward, hearty breakfast in a classic setting.

## International Flavors

Explore brunch beyond the usual American staples.

*   **Weekday Breakfast:** Don't forget many cafes and diners offer great breakfast options during the week with fewer crowds.
