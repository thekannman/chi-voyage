## Chicago Classics: The Essential Eats

No culinary exploration of Chicago is complete without indulging in its legendary staples. These aren't just meals; they're experiences woven into the city's fabric.

*   **Deep-Dish Pizza:** The star of the show! This isn't your average pizza. Expect a thick, buttery crust, a generous layer of mozzarella cheese, heaps of toppings, and tangy tomato sauce on top. Debate the best spots endlessly, but must-try institutions include Lou Malnati's, Pequod's (famous for its caramelized crust), Giordano's (known for its stuffed pizza), and Pizzeria Uno (the originator).

*   **Chicago-Style Hot Dog:** A true masterpiece of flavor and texture. It's an all-beef frankfurter (typically Vienna Beef) nestled in a steamed poppy seed bun, and famously **"dragged through the garden"** with specific toppings:
    *   Yellow mustard
    *   Chopped white onions
    *   Bright green sweet pickle relish
    *   A dill pickle spear
    *   Tomato slices or wedges
    *   Pickled sport peppers (for a little kick)
    *   A dash of celery salt
    *   **Crucially: No Ketchup!**
    *   *Where to try:* Portillo's, Superdawg Drive-In, The Wieners Circle (known for its late-night banter), Gene & Jude's.
*   **Italian Beef Sandwich:** A glorious mess of thinly sliced, seasoned roast beef simmered and soaked in its own flavorful gravy (*au jus*), piled high on a sturdy Italian roll. Customize it:
    *   **Dry:** Minimal gravy.
    *   **Wet (or Dipped):** The bread is quickly dipped in the *jus*.
    *   **Soaked (or Baptized):** The entire sandwich takes a swim!
    *   **Toppings:** Often served with sweet peppers (sautéed green bell peppers) or hot giardiniera (a spicy pickled vegetable relish).
    *   *Where to try:* Al's #1 Beef, Mr. Beef on Orleans, Johnnie's Beef (in Elmwood Park).
