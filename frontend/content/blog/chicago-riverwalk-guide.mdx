The Chicago Riverwalk is a stunning pedestrian path located on the south bank of the main branch of the Chicago River, right in the heart of downtown. Stretching for 1.25 miles from Lake Shore Drive west to Lake Street, it offers a unique, below-street-level perspective on Chicago's magnificent architecture, along with a growing number of restaurants, bars, boat tours, and recreational activities.

Once a purely industrial channel, the river has been transformed into a vibrant urban oasis. This guide will help you explore the different sections and attractions along the Chicago Riverwalk.

## Understanding the Riverwalk Sections

The Riverwalk is designed as a series of distinct "rooms" or blocks, each with its own character and amenities:

*   **The Marina Plaza (State St to Dearborn St):** Features restaurants and seating areas with excellent views of river traffic and the Marina City towers across the river.
*   **The Cove (Dearborn St to Clark St):** Offers kayak rentals and docks, providing direct access to the water for recreation.
*   **The River Theater (Clark St to LaSalle St):** A sculptural staircase links Upper Wacker Drive to the Riverwalk, creating amphitheater-style seating perfect for people-watching and enjoying the river views.
*   **The Water Plaza (LaSalle St to Wells St):** A bright, sunny area often featuring interactive water elements for children (seasonal).
*   **The Jetty (Wells St to Franklin St):** Highlights ecology, with floating gardens and opportunities to learn about the river's ecosystem. Also a good spot for fishing.
*   **The Boardwalk (Franklin St to Lake St):** A scenic stretch connecting the main Riverwalk to Lake Street, offering continuous views and access further west.
*   **East End (East of Michigan Ave):** The section closer to Lake Michigan offers wide paths, access to lakefront boat tours, and connections to the Lakefront Trail.

## Things to Do on the Riverwalk

*   **Dining & Drinking:** Numerous seasonal restaurants, cafes, wine bars, and breweries operate along the Riverwalk (typically May-October, weather permitting). Enjoy everything from casual snacks and cocktails to full meals with stunning architectural backdrops. Popular spots include City Winery, Tiny Tapp, Beat Kitchen on the Riverwalk, and Island Party Hut.
*   **Architecture Boat Tours:** Several major boat tour companies have docks directly on the Riverwalk (like the Wendella Boats or the Chicago Architecture Foundation Center tours). Taking an architecture cruise is one of the best ways to appreciate the city's buildings.
*   **Kayaking:** Rent kayaks (e.g., from Urban Kayaks at the Cove) for a unique self-guided tour or join a guided paddle along the river canyon.
*   **Water Taxis:** Use the Chicago Water Taxi (seasonal) for a scenic and practical way to travel between Riverwalk locations, Union Station/Ogilvie, Chinatown, and other stops.
*   **Public Art:** Look for various art installations, including murals and sculptures. Don't miss Art on theMART, a massive digital art projection displayed across the facade of the Merchandise Mart building in the evenings (visible from the Boardwalk section, check schedule).
*   **Fishing:** Permitted in designated areas like The Jetty (Illinois fishing license required).
*   **Walking & Relaxing:** Simply strolling the path, enjoying the views, and people-watching is a pleasure in itself. Find a bench and soak in the unique urban atmosphere.

## Accessing the Riverwalk

You can access the Riverwalk via staircases leading down from Upper Wacker Drive at almost every block between Lake Shore Drive and Lake Street. Look for signage indicating Riverwalk access. Elevator access is available at certain points (check the City of Chicago website for current accessibility information).

## Tips for Visiting

*   **Best Time:** Late spring through early fall offers the best weather and ensures most vendors are open. Evenings are magical with the city lights.
*   **Footwear:** Wear comfortable shoes, as you'll likely be doing a fair bit of walking.
*   **Crowds:** Can get very busy, especially on summer weekends and evenings.
*   **Check Hours:** Restaurant and vendor hours are often seasonal and weather-dependent.
*   **Sun Protection:** Much of the Riverwalk is exposed to the sun.
