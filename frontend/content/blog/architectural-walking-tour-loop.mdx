Chicago is globally renowned for its groundbreaking architecture. From the birth of the skyscraper to masterpieces of Art Deco, Modernism, and beyond, the city's downtown Loop district is a living museum of architectural innovation. While numerous guided tours are available, exploring on foot at your own pace offers a fantastic way to appreciate these structural marvels.

This self-guided walking tour focuses on some must-see architectural highlights within the Loop. Put on your comfortable shoes, grab your camera, and get ready to look up!

**(Note: This is a suggested route, feel free to adapt it based on your interests and starting point. Allow at least 2-3 hours.)**
